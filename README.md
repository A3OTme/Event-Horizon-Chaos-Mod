## 📌 About the Mod

**Event Horizon** is a mod that triggers a completely random gameplay-altering event every 60 seconds — from harmless visual quirks to full-blown global catastrophes!

✨ **Key Features:**
- **70+ unique events** (meteor showers, gravity shifts, mob spawns, and much more)
- **Flexible configuration** — disable disliked events or adjust their duration
- **Smooth control** — events last 2 minutes by default (fully customizable)
- **Multi-language support** — English and Russian out of the box

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This is an **EARLY VERSION (0.5.2)** released to gauge community interest. The mod is fully playable and stable, but its internal architecture will be rewritten in future releases.  
> **Your feedback could decide the fate of this mod!** If you like the concept, please leave a comment.
